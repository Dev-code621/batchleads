            The following Privacy Policy (the &quot;Policy&quot;) describes how
            [BatchDriven] (&quot;Company&quot;), which owns and operates the
            website BatchDriven.com collects, uses, and shares personally
            identifiable information and non-personally identifiable information
            through the website and mobile applications it operates
            (collectively, the “Sites”) and the services, features, or content
            we offer (collectively with the Sites, the &quot;Services&quot;).
            This Policy supplements the Terms of Use posted elsewhere within the
            Sites. You should read the Policy and the Terms of Use before you
            use the Sites. If you do not understand and agree with this Policy,

          </li>
          <li>
            Changes to this Policy. We may change the Policy at any time by
            posting revisions to the Policy on the Sites. Therefore, you should
            review the Policy from time to time. If you do not accept all of the
            terms, conditions and notices set forth in the Policy, you must exit
            the Sites immediately.
          </li>
          <li>
            Collection of Information from Children. We do not intentionally
            collect information from or regarding minors. The Sites are not
            directed to, or intended for use by, children under the age of 18.
            Children may not use or submit any information through the Sites or
            its Services. If you are under the age of 18, you may not use our

            submitting the information is a child, we will attempt to delete
            this information as soon as possible.
          </li>
          <li>
            Type of Information Collected. We may collect two general types of
            information when you use the Sites:
            <ol type="a" className="normal">
              <li>
                Personally Identifiable Information(&quot;PII&quot;), which
                includes contact and real estate data we source from third
                parties and sell to you, your first and last name, home or other
                physical address, telephone number, email address, user I.D.,
                other identifiers that permit physical or online contact with
                you, or any information about you collected online and
                maintained in personally identifiable form in combination with
                any of the preceding categories.You also may view or engage with
                our Sites and its Services through third - party social
                networking Sites or social media plug - ins and
                applications.When you engage with the Sites and its content
                through such third - party Sites, plug - ins or applications, we
                may have access to certain information from your social media
                profile, such as your name, photo, gender, birthday, location,
                videos, your list of friends, etc.This information is included
                in the definition of PII.
              </li>
              <li>
                Non-personally identifiable information (&quot;non-PII&quot;)
                such as, the type of browser you are using, the type of
                operating system you are using, the web pages you have visited
                sites visited before and after you visit the Sites, the type of
                handheld or mobile device used to access the Sites or other
                device-specific information.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            Certain features available within the Sites will require you to
            submit PII about yourself as a condition of participation. Some of
            the features may be offered by us, while others may be offered by
            third parties. (For example, you may be required to submit PII in
            order to request information and offers from us and our partners.)
            When you choose to submit PII to a third party in connection with
            your use of the Sites, the third party&lsquo;s privacy policy,
            rather than this Policy, will control the use of your PII. YOU CAN
            ALWAYS REFUSE TO PROVIDE PII TO US, BUT THIS MAY RESULT IN DECREASED
            FUNCTIONALITY OF THE SERVICES FOR YOU AND LIMIT YOUR ABILITY TO
            RECEIVE INFORMATION ABOUT SERVICES THAT MAY BE OF PARTICULAR
            INTEREST TO YOU.
          </li>
          <li>
            How Information is Collected. We collect information both actively
            and passively. For example, we will collect information about you
            that you voluntarily provide while on the Sites. In addition to
            information provided directly by you, we (and third parties that
            offer features through the Sites) may collect non-PII through the
            use of “cookies,” “web beacons,” “flash cookies” or by other
            electronic means.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cookies. In general, a cookie is a small amount of data sent to your
            browser from a web server and stored on your computer&lsquo;s hard
            drive, where it can be used to identify your computer. Cookies can
            be used to measure web Sites usage, improve navigation around web
            Sites, and personalize a returning visitor&lsquo;s experience on the
            web Sites. In most cases, you can set your browser to turn off
            cookies or to notify you before you receive one so that you can
            decide whether to accept it or not. Because cookies allow you to
            take advantage of some of the features on the Sites, we recommend
            that you leave them turned on. If you block or reject our cookies,
            some of the features on the Sites may not work for you. You can
            refer to the instructions for your browser to learn more about these
            functions.
          </li>
          <li>
            Web Beacons. We, our third-party service providers, advertisers and
            partners also may use “web beacons” or similar technologies. Web
            beacons are small strings of code placed on a web page to collect
            data about how visitors use the Sites. For example, web beacons may
            be used to count the number of users who visit the Sites or to
            deliver a cookie to the browser of a visitor to the Sites. If you
            set your browser to turn off cookies, web beacons and similar
            technologies will detect your visits to the Sites, but they will not
            associate your activity on the Sites with information that otherwise
            would be stored in cookies. We do not control tracking technologies
            used by third parties on the Sites.
          </li>
          <li>
            Flash Cookies. The Sites uses locally stored objects, also called
            “Flash cookies,” when it uses Adobe Flash Player (“Flash”) to
            provide special content such as video streaming, video on demand,
            video clips or animation. Flash, and similar applications, use Flash
            cookies to remember visitors&lsquo; Sites settings, preferences and
            usages. Flash cookies are managed directly through Adobe&lsquo;s
            websites, rather than through your web browser.
          </li>
          <li>
            Third-Party Advertising and Third-Party Web Sites. These Sites
            allows advertising by third parties that provide links to
            third-party web Sites. Internet advertising companies and the
            third-party websites on whose behalf they advertise (collectively
            “Third Parties”) may use the technology described above to send (or
            “serve”) directly to your browser the advertisements that appear on
            our Sites. When this happens, Third Parties automatically receive
            non-PII, such as information from your computer and browser,
            including your cookie information. They also may use cookies,
            Javascript, Pixel Tags and other technologies to deliver
            advertisements; collect information about the effectiveness of their
            advertisements; collect anonymous information about your visits to
            the Sites, such as the number of times you have viewed an ad; or
            customize the advertising content you see. Third Parties will not
            collect your name, address, or other PII, unless you affirmatively
            provide it to them. We let Third Parties set and access their
            cookies on your computer. Third Parties&lsquo; use of their own
            cookies is subject to their own privacy policies. For more
            information about these specialized cookies and other technologies,
            and to learn more about behavioral advertising or to opt out of this
            type of advertising for some companies, you can visit
            http://www.networkadvertising.org or
            http://networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp. When using a
            mobile application, you may receive tailored in-application
            advertisements. Each operating system provides its own instructions
            on how to prevent the delivery of tailored in-application
            advertisements. You may review the instructions and/or the privacy
            settings for your operating system to find out how to opt out of
            tailored in-application advertisements.

          <li>
            Third Party Links. Please note that this Sites contains links to
            other web Sites that do not follow this Policy. For instance,
            clicking on an advertisement, links or other elements on the Sites
            may take you to an entirely different Sites. Links to other Sites
            may use our Sites logo or style as a result of a co-branding
            agreement. These Sites may send their own cookies to you and may
            collect data and make use of that data in ways that this Sites would
            not. After you leave our Sites, this Policy will no longer apply to
            PII or any other data collected from or provided by you. You should
            check the other web Sites’ applicable privacy policy to determine
            how it will handle such data.

            Advertisements, Marketing Material and Other Offers. Unless you tell
            us that you do not want to receive these offers and subject to
            applicable law, the Company or those companies that we have a
            commercial relationship with, may occasionally send advertisements,

            interest to you. If you do not want to receive these advertisements,
            marketing material or other offers, please contact us using the
            contact information found at the end of this Policy. Where required
            by law, we will seek your consent prior to sending you any marketing
            materials. To the extent allowed by law, the provision of your email

            promotional and informational reasons. You agree that this consent

            required to provide such consent in order to make a purchase as you
            can always contact us directly to arrange an alternate purchase
            method. By providing your telephone number to us, you certify that
            this is your own number that you own, and not a line owned or used
            by another, and that you will immediately notify us if your number
            changes or is reassigned. You agree to indemnify us if this is not
            the case and if the future owner or user of the number makes a claim
            against us for contact at that number. You may opt out of such
            contact at any time and through any of the reasonable methods

            Forums. The Sites may include forums (such as message boards, chat
            rooms, comment boards, and reviews) that enable users to post a
            comment or communicate with each other. We are under no obligation

            Information Security. We take information security seriously, and we
            use reasonable administrative, technical and physical safeguards to
            protect the PII we collect from unauthorized access, use or
            disclosure. But we have no control over the security of other
            websites on the Internet that you might visit. If you share your
            computer or use a computer that is accessed by the general public,
            remember to sign off and close your browser window when you have
            finished your session. This will help to ensure that others cannot
            access your PII.
          </li>
          <li>
            Additionally, and as you are likely aware, no system can be
            completely secure. Therefore, although we take commercially
            reasonable steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and
            you should not expect, that your PII, searches or other
            communications always will remain secure. In the event of a breach
            of the confidentiality or security of your PII, we will notify you
            if reasonably possible and as reasonably necessary so that you can
            take appropriate protective steps. We may notify you under such
            circumstances using the e-mail address(es) we have on record for
            you. You should also take care with how you handle and disclose your
            PII. Please refer to the Federal Trade Commission&apos;s Web Sites
            at http://www.consumer.ftc.gov/ for information about how to protect
            against identity theft.

          <li>
            Your Rights. Under the law of some countries, you may have certain
            rights with respect to your PII. These rights include the right to:

            California Privacy Rights. Under California law, California
            residents may request once a year, free of charge, certain
            information regarding our disclosure of PII to third parties for
            direct marketing purposes. Specifically, we will provide a list of
            the categories of PII disclosed to third parties for third-party
            direct marketing purposes, along with the names and addresses of
            these third parties. To make such a request, please contact us using
            the contact information at the bottom of this Policy. We reserve our
            right not to respond to requests submitted other than to the contact
            points listed below. You should put “California Privacy Rights” in
            the subject line and in your request. We may need to verify your
            identity before providing information to you.

            California Do Not Track Disclosure. Certain web browsers may allow
            you to enable a “do not track” option that sends signals to the
            websites you visit indicating that you do not want your online
            activities tracked. This is different than blocking cookies as
            browsers with the “do not track” option selected may still accept
            cookies. Our Sites currently do not have the functionality to
            recognize or honor “do not track” browser signaling. We do not
            respond to &quot;do not track&quot; signals. If we do so in the
            future, we will modify this Policy accordingly.

          a business does not “sell” personal information when a consumer uses

          provided the third party does not also sell the personal information,
