            <b>Non-Exclusive Software License: </b>
            Upon Subscriber’s agreement to these
            terms and receipt of the required monthly subscription fees,
            Subscriber will be entitled to and BatchDriven grants Subscriber on
            a limited, revocable, non-exclusive license to use the BatchDriven
            prospecting services which may include blended inbound and outbound
            calling (with call recording and monitoring), SMS marketing, direct
            mail, ringless voicemail and email (“the services” or “the
            software”) described on BatchDriven’s then-current website,
            currently located at BatchDriven.com (“the website”). This Agreement
            shall commence on the date payment is made and continue for one
            calendar month, after which shall automatically renew for successive
            one-month renewal terms until terminated by either party. Monthly
            subscription fees are to be paid in advance and are non-refundable,
            even if Subscriber cancels mid-month or does not make use of the
            software. Additional in-app purchases are also available. Subscriber
            alone is the authorized user of the software and Subscriber may not
            allow any other person or entity (“Unauthorized Users”) to make any
            use of the software, Subscribers own authorized sub-users who review
            and agree to these same terms. BatchDriven reserves the right to, at
            a later time, restrict the maximum number of Subscriber’s sub users.
            Subscriber must immediately report to BatchDriven any use or
            attempted use of the software by any Unauthorized Users. Subscriber
            may not, at any time, resell or re-license the software to any
            Unauthorized User. Upon termination by either party, this license
            shall immediately terminate and Subscriber shall make no further use
            of the software. Except as otherwise specifically permitted in this
            Agreement, Subscriber may not: (a) modify or create any derivative
            works of any software, service or documentation, including
            translation or localization (code written to published APIs
            (application programming interfaces) for the software shall not be
            deemed derivative works); (b) sublicense or permit simultaneous use
            of the software by more than one user; (c) reverse engineer,
            decompile, or disassemble or otherwise attempt to derive the source
            code for any software related to the software (except to the extent
            applicable laws specifically prohibit such restriction); (d)
            redistribute, encumber, sell, rent, lease, sublicense, use the
            software in a timesharing or service bureau arrangement, or
            otherwise transfer rights to any software; (e) remove or alter any
            trademark, logo, copyright or other proprietary notices, legends,
            symbols or labels in the software; (f) publish any results of
            benchmark tests run on any software to a third-party without prior
            express written consent from BatchDriven The software license shall
            immediately and automatically be suspended if at any time,
            Subscriber defaults under its obligations under this Agreement or
            for nonpayment. BatchDriven also reserves the right to terminate
            Subscriber’s account at any time in its sole discretion for any or
            no reason whatsoever.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Limited Account: </b>
            During the term of this agreement and while
            Subscriber is in full compliance with these terms and with its
            payment obligations, Subscriber’s license shall allow Subscriber
            generally our BatchDriven prospecting services and the related
            features listed on the website. The service is offered through a
            mobile app as well as a browser-based website and includes
            reasonable, limited tech support and training as available.
            BatchDriven cannot guarantee the reliability of its third-party
            providers/suppliers related to the domains or app, or that the
            hosting services shall be available at all times or free from
            isolated errors. Reasonable hosting down time may occur, including
            without limitation for provider outages, system upgrades,
            maintenance, repairs, and acts of god/nature. BatchDriven assumes no
            legal responsibility or liability for Subscriber’s use of the domain
            or app. Subscriber must operate in full compliance with all laws and
            regulations and must not use the assigned domain or app for any
            other purpose not contemplated herein. Subscriber understands that
            if BatchDriven receives a court order, subpoena, civil investigative
            demand or other legal notice that BatchDriven deems in its
            discretion to be valid, BatchDriven may be required (or elect in its
            discretion) to produce information related to Subscriber, and/or
            suspend or terminate the hosting. BatchDriven may suspend or
            terminate the hosting at any time in the event it reasonably
            believes Subscriber has violated the law, or subjected BatchDriven
            to unreasonable legal exposure.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Record Retention: </b>
            BatchDriven will assume no obligation to maintain
            records related to Subscriber’s campaign or this agreement.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Refund Policy: </b>
            Subscriber’s monthly payment obligations and any
            in-app purchases are not refundable.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Compliance with Law: </b>
            BatchDriven is merely a passive technology
            provider and common carrier. Subscriber is required to use the
            software in full compliance with all applicable laws and
            regulations, including without limitation, all state, federal and
            international: (1) Do-Not-Call (“DNC”) registry prohibitions; (2)
            licensing and bonding requirements; (3) consumer cancellation
            rights; (4) mandatory disclosures; (5) cell phone restrictions; (6)
            text messaging restrictions; (7) opt-out rules; (8) call recording
            laws; (9) record retention requirements; and (10) direct mail rules
            and best practices; (11) CANSPAM Act and related email rules; and
            (12) all other applicable laws and regulations.. By making any use
            of the software, Subscriber expressly warrants to us that Subscriber
            is and shall continue to act in full compliance with the law. All
            BatchDriven offers are void where prohibited by law. BatchDriven
            does not assume responsibility for ensuring that Subscriber’s
            campaigns meet applicable legal requirements. BatchDriven will not
            assume any liability if Subscriber is ever held guilty or liable for
            any law violation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Subscriber
            acknowledges that BatchDriven has and is taking active steps to
            ensure the compliance of its customers, including by having
            Subscriber agree to these terms. We cannot guarantee that you have
            the legal right to contact individuals using contact information
            provided by us—it is Subscribers sole obligation to ensure that they
            have proper consent or other legal exemption.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Opt-Outs:</b>
            Subscriber acknowledges and agrees that it must honor all
            opt-outs and consent revocations received and is solely responsible
            for doing so.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Cell Phones: </b>
            Subscriber understands and acknowledges that
            BatchDriven is not responsible for removing of flagging which
            telephone numbers are wireless phone numbers as opposed to
            landlines.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>No Legal, Financial or Tax Advice Provided: </b>
            No financial, legal, or
            tax advice or counsel is given, or shall be deemed to have been
            given by BatchDriven or its affiliates and contractors, or by the
            software.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Indemnification: </b>
            Subscriber shall assume, pay, indemnify, hold
            harmless, and reimburse BatchDriven and its owners, employees,
            agents, affiliates, contractors, successors and assigns for any and
            all liabilities, damages, claims, suits, settlements, judgments,
            costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees and court
            costs) directly or indirectly incurred by BatchDriven to the extent
            the same are related in any way to Subscriber’s use of the software
            or which are primarily attributable to the negligence or intentional
            acts or omissions by Subscriber, Subscriber’s owners, officers,
            employees, agents and representatives, including any authorized or
            unauthorized users. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained
            herein shall release BatchDriven from any liability for its own
            gross negligence, except as allowed by law.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Limitation of Liability: </b>
            Neither party shall be liable for any
            consequential, incidental, special, or indirect damages (including,
            but not limited to, loss of profits, goodwill, use, data, or other
            intangible items) even if the other party has been advised of the
            possibility of such damages or losses. With respect to any other
            damages, BatchDriven’s liability hereunder shall in no event exceed
            an amount equal to the amount actually paid by Subscriber to
            BatchDriven in the month prior to a claim being made, regardless of
            the basis for the claim. Subscriber understands that this is a
            significant limitation on Subscriber’s right to sue BatchDriven and
            Subscriber should not proceed if Subscriber does not agree.
            BatchDriven shall not be bound by any typographical or other error
            or misprint in its marketing materials or online purchase websites,
            so long as BatchDriven provides prompt notice of any such error and
            corrects the same.

            SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING, WITHOUT
            LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, OR
            LOSS OF INFORMATION) ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE
            THE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF BatchDriven HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
            POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. BatchDriven cannot be responsible if
            Subscriber makes changes, misuses, or tampers with the software or
            hardware after Subscriber receives them. Any installation of other
            software or changes by Subscriber may void the warranty; any tech
            support required because of virus contamination will be at
            Subscriber’s expense at the rate of up to $300 per hour. This
            warranty and the obligations and liabilities of BatchDriven are in
            lieu of, and Subscriber waives, all other warranties, guarantees,
            conditions, or liabilities, expressed or implied, arising by law or
            otherwise, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE IMPLIED WARRANTY OF
            MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, and further
            including without limitation consequential damages, whether or not
            caused by BatchDriven’s negligence. This warranty shall not be
            extended, altered, or varied except by a written agreement signed by
            BatchDriven and Subscriber. BatchDriven is not responsible for any
            failure of a DNC or wireless list provider to deliver its data
            accurately, completely, or in a timely way. BatchDriven is not
            responsible for damages resulting from improper or incomplete use by
            Subscriber of BatchDriven’s products and services.

            <b>Intellectual Property: </b>
            “BatchDriven” and all related trade and
            service marks are and shall remain the exclusive intellectual
            property of BatchDriven and Subscriber specifically acknowledge that

            or right to use any trademark or service mark of the other party or
            its affiliates, unless the party wishing to use a trademark or

            which the owning party may grant or withhold in its sole discretion.
            Subscriber acknowledges that the software is protected by state,

            <b>Legal Relationship: </b>
            By this Agreement, no partnership, joint
            venture, independent contractor, or ownership relationship is formed
            beyond that of a product Subscriber and Seller, and that of a
            software licensor and licensee.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Choice of Law: </b>
            This Agreement shall be governed by and construed
            according to the laws of the State of Arizona, without giving effect

            suit by BatchDriven to collect the purchase price or other fees owed
            by Subscriber pursuant to the Agreement, the parties agree that a
            party asserting any claim or dispute regarding this Agreement shall

          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Other Important Disclaimers: </b>
            Subscriber is not purchasing a
            “franchise”, “business opportunity”, “strategic or targeted
            marketing plan”, or “exclusive territory” from BatchDriven
            Subscriber understands that computers and telecommunications are
            complex, and that it may take time, effort, and skill to install,
            understand, and operate the same. Subscriber must allow ample time
            to receive, set up, test, and understand his or her system before
            advertising or going on-line to the public. Subscriber is aware that
            there is a wide variety of computer hardware and software, as well
            as telephone companies and equipment. For this reason, BatchDriven
            does not warrant that its products will function in every
            environment. It is the Subscriber’s responsibility to obtain the
            necessary computer equipment to operate these products. It is the
            Subscriber’s responsibility to become aware of the cost and
            availability of telephone and electrical requirements. Subscriber is
            responsible for any business and miscellaneous expenses necessary to
            operate these products, including telephone service, advertising,
            computers, etc. BatchDriven will not be liable for these expenses
            for any reason. Even though Subscriber’s system may be designed to
            operate 24 hours a day, Subscriber should be aware that the system
            may be out of service periodically for backups, maintenance,
            improvements, or difficulties such as power outages, telephone line
            problems, hardware/software malfunctions, carrier outages, etc.
            BatchDriven will not be liable for any lost revenue, lost profits,
            advertising, or additional expenses due to loss of data,
            hardware/software problems, failure of the system (or phone
            carriers) to successfully record calls, or for any reason.
            Subscriber is aware there will be limitations as to the size of the
            software applications and to the number of telephone lines that can
            be used, due to hardware and software limitations. BatchDriven does
            not make any claims or guarantees that Subscriber will bring in any
            revenue or operate any profitable services or businesses by using
            the software or hardware sold by BatchDriven. The success of the
            Subscriber will be affected by many factors, including, but not
            limited to, his or her efforts and competence. Subscriber is
            responsible for the security of its own systems and data and for
            obtaining its own applicable insurance.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Minimum Requirements: </b>
            Purchaser is required to obtain and maintain a
            sufficient browser and bandwidth in order to use the services.
            Subscriber must provide high-speed internet connection for training,
            updates, and technical support. The Subscriber is responsible for
            Network Configuration, Antivirus, Router and Firewall, Installation,
            Configuration, and Setup. SIP Carrier testing is required. Minimum
            Requirements are subject to change at any time. BatchDriven cannot
            be responsible if Subscriber makes changes, misuses, or tampers with
            the software or hardware after Subscriber receives them. Any
            installation of other software or changes by Subscriber may void the
            warranty and Subscriber will be charged up to $300 as a
            reconfiguration fee.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Technical Support: </b>
            Technical support is generally available (subject
            to reasonable down time) Monday through Saturday during regular
            business hours. These times are subject to change based upon our
            evolving business practices, as well as unforeseen events out of our
            control. BatchDriven will make every reasonable effort to resolve
            questions and problems on a timely basis, within the times listed
            above; however, BatchDriven may not always be able to resolve every
            problem, nor respond to every call immediately. BatchDriven and
            Subscriber each agree to pay for their own long distance calls
            placed to the other party for any assistance.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Backups: </b>
            Subscriber is responsible for making frequent backups of
            his or her system to protect against any loss of valuable data.
            BatchDriven cannot be responsible for loss of data for any reason
            whatsoever.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Non-Payment: </b>
            Subscriber is responsible for paying all fees and
            applicable taxes associated with the monthly subscription. If
            Subscriber’s payment method fails or account is past due,
            BatchDriven may collect fees owed using other payment methods on
            file, and adding a service fee of $50 per month overdue. If at any
            time Subscriber defaults under this agreement for non-payment or
            otherwise, the software license shall immediately and automatically
            terminate until such time as Subscriber’s account is current.

            Further, Subscriber
            understands that by signing below, Subscriber is giving BatchDriven
            and its employees permission to contact Subscriber at the telephone
            number and email address Subscriber has provided, regardless of any

            the possible use of automated telemarketing systems, SMS technology,
            emails, as well as prerecorded messages. Communications will be used
